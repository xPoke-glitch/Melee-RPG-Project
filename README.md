This is a **test project** for a **melee combat system** in a RPG game

## The Game

It's a test project so there is not an actual objective.

The player can move around the world and attack a mannequin or a dummy enemy AI which is wandering around.

## Requirements

If you only want to run the game and play:
* Windows 64bit

If you want to open, edit or see the Unity project:
* Unity 2020.3.20f1 (or greater)

## How to play

In order to play the game you have two options:
* Open the project with the recommended Unity version and play it from the game window
* Open the project with the recommended Unity version and build it for your platform

The commands are really simple:
* W/A/S/D: Move the player
* W/A/S/D + Left Shift: Run
* Left mouse click: Light sword attack (less damage to enemies)
* Right mouse click: Heavy sword attack (more damage to enemies)
* Mouse wheel: Adjust camera zoom

## Gameplay example

This is an example that shows you how the game looks like. In this scene you can see how the melee system works.

## Test notes

This was my first time creating a melee combat system.

The melee system works as expected. I had to confront with the many problems that a good melee system usually brings. I had to fix many different bugs, the system works but it's not perfect, sometimes (I would say rarely tho) they hits may miss the target.

The mentioned problem can be fixed in different ways, but because I had no time when I did the project, I didn't totally fixed it.

Last thing that I don't really like is the trail effect. I tried to do it all by myself with particles, although I could have used a trail renderer component.

The enemy AI can be improved, but it is a test project so I didn't want to dive too deep into it.

Generally, I love the environment, the models and also how the melee system works.

Finally, in this project, I experimented a little with the Cinemachine camera zoom, as you can see from the commands.
