## The Game

It's a test project so there is not an actual objective.

The player can move around the world and attack a mannequin or a dummy enemy AI which is wandering around.

## Requirements

If you only want to run the game and play:
* Windows 64bit

If you want to open, edit or see the Unity project:
* Unity 2020.3.20f1 (or greater)

## How to play

In order to play the game you have two options:
* Open the project with the recommended Unity version and play it from the game window
* Open the project with the recommended Unity version and build it for your platform

The commands are really simple:
* W/A/S/D: Move the player
* W/A/S/D + Left Shift: Run
* Left mouse click: Light sword attack (less damage to enemies)
* Right mouse click: Heavy sword attack (more damage to enemies)
* Mouse wheel: Adjust camera zoom

## Gameplay example

This is an example that shows you how the game looks like. In this scene you can see how the melee system works.
